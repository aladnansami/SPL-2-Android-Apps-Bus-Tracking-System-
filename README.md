# SPL-2-Android-Apps-Bus-Tracking-System-
Travelling by bus to go for university is the most common thing and also a hassle for students and 
teachers waiting for the bus. Many times, students and teachers wait for the bus which is not 
available at that time and it might take a lot of time to reach University. Due to this problem many 
times they waste their precious time since they do not have the information about the alternative 
buses and many a times they get late for their exams. Therefore, this project is focusing to provide 
a solution to this problem by giving the proper and accurate information about the bus to the 
students and teachers. We also ensure the necessary security of information and other processes.

# Scope of the Project
We want to build a system which will track the current position and direction of the bus and show 
it to the user who wants to travel by the bus. The driver will share his location that’s will show to 
the user the current position of bus. The system will reduce the waiting time for travelling
### There are three types of stakeholders in our “NSTU Bus Tracking System”. Such as:<br>
Driver: Driver share their location which used to provide the user the current location of the 
bus. <br>
Student: Student can get the current direction and location of the bus when they once logged 
in to the system.<br>
Teacher: Teacher can get the current direction and location of the bus when they once logged 
in to the system.
